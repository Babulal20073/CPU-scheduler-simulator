# CPU Scheduler Simulator

## Overview

The **CPU Scheduler Simulator** is a web-based application designed to help users understand and visualize various CPU scheduling algorithms. This project provides an interactive interface where users can input processes, select scheduling algorithms, and analyze key performance metrics such as Turnaround Time and Waiting Time.

---

## Features

- **Supports multiple CPU scheduling algorithms:**
  - First Come First Serve (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Round Robin (RR)
  - Priority Scheduling

- **Process Input Interface:**  
  - Allows users to enter process details, including Burst Time, Arrival Time, and Priority.

- **Visualization:**
  - Generates Gantt charts for process execution.
  - Displays a comparison of scheduling algorithms.

- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Computes Waiting Time, Turnaround Time, and Response Time for all processes.
